\chapter{Appendix C - ChainAPI Code}

The original instance of ChainAPI can be found and installed from \url{https://github.com/ResEnv/chain-api}, and a browsable version of the Tidmarsh data backend in ChainAPI can be found at \url{http://chain-api.media.mit.edu/}.  It is well worth checking out some of the interesting visualizations at \url{http://tidmarsh.media.mit.edu/viz/} and some of the interesting projects built on top of ChainAPI at \url{http://tidmarsh.media.mit.edu/}.

The air quality version of ChainAPI is an on-going work, and the latest version can be found on github at \url{http://github.com/dramsay9/chain-api}.  A testing and development version of this instance is generally available for browsing at \url{http://learnair.media.mit.edu:8000}. The pre-processing and machine learning scripts can be found in a jupyter notebook at \url{http://github.com/dramsay9/learnair-data-crunching}, while the main chain tools are found in their corresponding git repository: \url{http://github.com/dramsay9/chaincrawler}, \url{http://github.com/dramsay9/chainlearnairdata}, and \url{http://github.com/dramsay9/chaindataprocessor}.
